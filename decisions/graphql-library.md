# GraphQL Library

We recommend that Apollo be used for building GraphQL APIs.  This decision may change if Relay expands support for Angular and more Excellians have experience with Relay.

## Considerations

- Documentation
- Community / Support
- Dev Experience at Excella
- Ease of use
- Compatablity
- How opinionated

## Benefits
### Apollo

- Supports a number of languages / technologies
- Flexible (less opinionated)
- Bigger user-base & community
- Great documentation
- GUI Playground (Graphical)
- Has implementations for Angular and React (with hooks)
- Vast majority of Excella’s experience is with Apollo
- Has a Chrome Extension for help debugging

### Relay

- Built/supported by Facebook
- Highly opinionated with strong best practices
- Higher Order Component for Easy Pagination
- Chrome extension for debugging
- Better (automatic) cache management when doing mutations

## Negatives

### Apollo

- Not clearly opinionated
- Focus is split between multiple languages/libraries
- Doesn’t automatically update the cache when data is mutated
- Some more advanced features require per developer licenses
 
### Relay

- Less established
- React / React Native only
- Little to no expertise at Excella
