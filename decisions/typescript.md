# TypeScript

We recommend that all JavaScript projects (Angular, React, or Node) should use TypeScript. The benefits that it provides outweighs the time it takes to set it up as long as the project is running for more than a week.

## Benefits

- Adds Class, Module, and Typing support
- Helps with project scalability
- Helps with teams that are growing or changing team members
- Helps with handoff to other project teams
- Helps provide intellesense
- A form of object documentation
- Makes refactoring easier
- Improves code readability

## Negatives

- Takes time to implement
- Takes time to learn
- Can sometimes get confusing when implemented in JSX
